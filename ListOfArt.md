# Notes #
  * The scale for the art is 1 pixel = 2 inches.
  * All tiles should be 32\*32px
  * Make sure the edges of your artwork come up to the border of the image. The velociraptor is currently "floating" a couple pixels above the ground because the image height is a bit bigger than the actual image content.
  * If you would like to work on something listed here that you think will take a long time, write your name next to the item.
  * Please edit and add to this list!
  * Please keep a consistent style. Use the "box" and "barrel" sprites for an idea of what I'm looking for.
  * Here is the layout of our first level, to give you an idea: http://abpotato.com/files/trusted/levels.zip You can also use this for scale (1 grid space = 16px), but the real-world scale takes precedence.

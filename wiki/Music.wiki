This is a guideline for anybody composing music for the game.
 * *Main menu/theme* - should sound heroic, cinematic, like an action/adventure movie
 * *Labratory* - should be eerie, quiet, sci-fi, have lots of mechanical ambience
 * *Jungle* - should sound primitive, cinematic, have lots of drums and maybe flutes, also lots of jungle ambience
 * *Pirates* - should be pirate-y!
 * *Ninjas* - should sound oriental
 * *Zombies* - should be like a horror flick soundtrack
 * *Robots* - should be techno, maybe sound like action, horror
 * *Final battle* - epic, cinematic
 * *Credits* - the only requirement here is that it should be awesome

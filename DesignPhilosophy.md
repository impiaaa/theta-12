Many of these are taken right from Valve's philosophy. 

&lt;rant&gt;


  * Form should represent function and qualities. If a weapon looks big, heavy, and powerful, it should be a powerful weapon. If an enemy has a thin profile, is small, and looks nonthreatening, it shouldn't be a boss. A healthpack should look like a healthpack.
  * Everything should feel fair. If the player dies, they need to feel like they could have lived if they only fought a bit better. As a corollary, the player should always easily know what killed them.
  * The player should never, ever have to learn something by dying. They need to theoretically be able to play through the entire game without dying once.
  * The player should never, ever have to suicide/load a previous save because they have become stuck/doomed/in some situation where it is impossible for them to continue.
  * Foreshadowing is good. This is not in the complex, metaphorical sense from literature, but the player should see what is coming ahead of time.
  * Everything needs to be unique. If you are going to have multiple guns, they not only need to look and sound very distinct, but should have different functions. All things must have easily identifiable cues, both visual and auditory.
  * Never take control away from the player. That includes cutscenes.
  * It is debatable, but ideally the fourth wall should not be broken in any way. This means the protagonist can't talk--the player isn't connected with their character if it has free will. It is possible to write good dialogue without the player character ever talking--Half Life, Half Life 2 along with its episodes, and Portal are great examples.
  * Very often, level design really should be linear. This does two important things. It allows the game to be adjusted more easily for the player's experience; and also, it ensures that all work we do can be enjoyed in one playthrough.
  * For any sort of puzzle (which can be taken in an abstract sense as the whole game), once the player has figured out the solution to the puzzle, it should be easy for them to solve it.
  * Only teach one thing at a time.
  * The player should never have to completely figure anything out on their own. Things should be hinted with lighting, coloration, etc.
